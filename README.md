Arduino IR Receiver
=

Description
-
An IR receiver designed to work with XBMC across all platforms.  It is built on the Arduino platform and translates a set of known IR codes to USB HID (Keyboard) codes that are meant to work with XBMC.

Currently a Harmony Remote 650 programmed with the "Windows Media Center SE" is being used in conjunction with OpenELEC on an AMD Fusion computer.

The project is a work in progress so some things may not work 100%.
